# Help Me To Speak

**Help Me To Speak** is a Flutter-based translator platform designed to connect users with real-time interpreters. Users can select interpreters based on language preferences and communicate via video calls, voice calls, or text messaging.

The app features a credit system (coin-based), where users purchase coins to initiate conversations. Depending on the communication method (video, voice, or text), coins are deducted at the end of each session. This makes Help Me To Speak a flexible, pay-as-you-go solution for multilingual communication needs.
